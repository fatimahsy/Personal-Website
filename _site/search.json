    "text": "I am a student currently pursuing a major in Economics and minors in Statistics and Environmental Ethics at the University of Toronto. My academic jorney has provided me with a strong foundation in understanding economic principles, statistical methodologies, and viewing issues through an ethical lens.\nBeyond the classroom, i am deeply committed to environmental sustainability. My minor in environmental Ethics reflects my dedication to exploring the ethical considerations surrounding environmental challenges. I believe that a sustainable future requires a multidisciplinary approach, and i am eager to contribute my skills to the crutial cause.\nWith a keen interest in Statistics, I enjoy delving into data analysis to derive meaningful insights. I find joy in unraveling patterns and trends that can inform decision-making processes. My statistical background equips me with the tools to tackle complex problems and make informed choices.\nBeyond academia, I am deeply involved in community service. As a mentor at the Muslim Students association, I am privileged to guide and support fellow students on their academic and personal journeys. Volunteering and mentorship hold a special place in my heart, reflecting my belief in the power of community and shared growth.\nWhen Iâ€™m not immersed in academic or volunteer activities, I indulge in my love for sports. I am an avid Formula One and football fan, enjoying the thrill of high-speed races and the excitement of competitive football matches."
