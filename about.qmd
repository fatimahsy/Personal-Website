👋 Hello there! I'm Fatimah Yunusa, a passionate student currently navigating the world of academia at the University of Toronto. With a major in Economics, a minor in Statistics and Environmental Ethics, and an array of diverse interests, my journey is a tapestry of exploration, learning, and giving back.

📚 Academic Explorer
As a student, I've delved into the intricate realms of Economics, where I uncover the dynamics of markets, explore statistical landscapes, and grapple with the ethical considerations of environmental issues. The pursuit of knowledge is not just a path for me—it's an exciting adventure.

🌍 Environmental Advocate
Beyond the textbooks, I am on a mission to contribute to a sustainable future. My engagement in environmental advocacy, coupled with a minor in Environmental Ethics, underscores my commitment to understanding and addressing the ecological challenges that shape our world.

🤝 Community Contributor
Volunteering is a cornerstone of my life. Serving as a mentor at the University Muslim Students Association is a source of immense pride and joy. Guiding and supporting fellow students on their journeys is a privilege, and I am continually inspired by the power of community and shared growth.

🍳 Creative Cook
The kitchen is my canvas, and cooking is my artistic expression. Whether it's experimenting with new recipes or crafting familiar favorites, the joy of cooking is a cherished part of my life. Join me on a culinary journey filled with flavors and stories.

⚽🏎️ My World of Sports
When not immersed in academic or community pursuits, I'm cheering for my favorite football team or catching the exhilarating moments of a Formula One race. Sports are not just entertainment for me; they are a source of excitement, camaraderie, and inspiration.
